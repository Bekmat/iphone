            1. Offer valid on qualifying purchases of Eligible Products from
            November 24, 2023, to November 27, 2023, at a Qualifying Location.
            Offer subject to availability. While supplies last. Qualifying
            purchasers can receive a discount equal to the value of the
            Promotion Product (depending on their purchase) off the price of the
            Eligible Product, but will be charged for all items in their cart.
            Important notice regarding the checkout receipt and monthly
            statement for Apple Card Monthly Installments (ACMI) purchases with
            this promotion: A purchase of an Eligible Product made when
            selecting ACMI (a 0% APR payment option available only in the U.S.)
            as the payment type at checkout will receive an instant credit equal
            to the cost of the Promotion Product (Apple Gift Card) deducted from
            the price of the Eligible Product at the time of purchase. You will
            be charged one ACMI installment plan for the Eligible Product
            discounted by the instant credit. The value of the Promotion Product
            (i.e., the value of the Apple Gift Card) will also be charged in a
            separate second ACMI installment plan for the same number of months
            as the discounted Eligible Product. The total combined amount
            charged over the 2 separate ACMI installment plans will reflect the
            original full retail price of the Eligible Product. Separately, you
            will receive and be charged for the Promotion Product
            (Apple Gift Card) in the amount of the applicable instant credit.
            ACMI is a 0% APR payment option that is only available if you select
            it at checkout in the U.S. for eligible Apple products purchased at
            Apple Store locations, apple.com, the Apple Store app, or by calling
            1-800-MY-APPLE, and is subject to credit approval and credit limit.
            See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for more information about
            eligible products. APR ranges may vary based on when you accepted an
            Apple Card. Cardholders who accept an Apple Card on and/or after
            August 10, 2023: Variable APRs for Apple Card, other than ACMI,
            range from 19.24% to 29.49% based on creditworthiness. Rates as of
            August 10, 2023. Existing cardholders: See your Customer Agreement
            for applicable rates and fee. If you buy an ACMI-eligible product by
            choosing to pay in full with Apple Card (instead of using ACMI),
            that purchase is subject to the Apple Card variable APR, not 0% APR.
            Taxes and shipping on ACMI purchases are subject to the variable
            APR, not 0% APR. You’ll need to select AT&T, T-Mobile, or Verizon as
            your carrier when you check out. An iPhone purchased with ACMI is
            always unlocked, so you can switch carriers at any time. ACMI is not
            available for purchases made online at the following special stores:
            Apple Employee Purchase Plan; participating corporate Employee
            Purchase Programs; Apple at Work for small businesses; Government,
            and Veterans and Military Purchase Programs, or on refurbished
            devices. The last month’s payment for each product will be the
            product’s purchase price, less all other payments at the monthly
            payment amount. ACMI financing is subject to change at any time for
            any reason, including but not limited to, installment term lengths
            and eligible products. See support.apple.com/kb/HT211204 for
            information about upcoming changes to ACMI financing. See the
            Apple Card Customer Agreement for more information about ACMI
            financing. Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Salt Lake
            City Branch. Available for qualifying applicants in the United
            States. If you reside in the U.S. territories, please call Goldman
            Sachs at 877-255-5923 with questions about accessing this offer or
            applying for Apple Card. Except for ACMI, this offer cannot be
            combined with other Apple promotions or financing offers that are
            directed to individual end-user customers in the Qualifying
            Location. This offer also cannot be combined with the Apple Employee

            2. Trade-in values will vary based on the condition, year, and
            configuration of your eligible trade-in device. Not all devices are
            eligible for credit. You must be at least 18 years old to be
            eligible to trade in for credit or for an Apple Gift Card. Trade-in
            value may be applied toward qualifying new device purchase, or added
            to an Apple Gift Card. Actual value awarded is based on receipt of a
            qualifying device matching the description provided when estimate
            was made. Sales tax may be assessed on full value of a new device
            purchase. In-store trade-in requires presentation of a valid photo
            ID (local law may require saving this information). Offer may not be
            available in all stores, and may vary between in-store and online
            trade-in. Some stores may have additional requirements. Apple or its
            trade-in partners reserve the right to refuse or limit quantity of
            any trade-in transaction for any reason. More details are available
            from Apple’s trade-in partner for trade-in and recycling of eligible
            devices. Restrictions and limitations may apply.
